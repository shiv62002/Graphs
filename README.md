This project simulates an online testing system. As part of the code, an exam generator is programmed to create different types of questions 
(true/false, multiple choice, and fill-in-blank questions). Each type of question is organized within a different class using hashmaps and inheritance 
relationships. The individual classes also keep track of individual students who took the exams, the performance of each student on the exam, and the performance 
of the class as a whole. Last a command line interpreter is utilized to output a studentâ€™s name, exam, answers. 

The code in this project enables me to exhibit my knowledge and understading of OOP, serialization, interfaces, polymorphism, and hash maps. The code also enables
me to showcase my ability to develop a simple a command line interpreter to showcase basic functionalities of a system. Overall, this project enables me to 
highlight my proficiency in using java to develop a complex program.
